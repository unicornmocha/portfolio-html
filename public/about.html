<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m an aspiring software developer with a strong focus on Python. I started my coding journey by learning the basics of programming and quickly fell in love with problem-solving and building small projects.</p>

<p>I’ve completed courses in Python, AI fundamentals, and AI & cybersecurity, and I’ve also explored C# along the way. Right now, I’m expanding into web development to better understand how the frontend and backend work together.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning new technologies, building projects, and challenging myself with coding problems. This portfolio is a small step in showing what I’m working on and where I’m headed next.</p>
